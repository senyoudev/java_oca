# Why Is There a new Date and Time API?

In java SE8, a new date and time API was introduced to fix the shortcomings of the existing java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes. The new API is located in the java.time package and is inspired by the Joda-Time library.

The old date and time classes had several problems:

- **Immutability**: The old classes were mutable, which means that they could be changed after they were created. This could lead to problems in multi-threaded applications.

- **Poor Design**: The old classes had poor design and were difficult to use.

- **Inconsistency**: The old classes were inconsistent and had poor support for internationalization.

- **Time Zone Issues**: The old classes had poor support for time zones and daylight saving time.

The new date and time API addresses these problems by providing a clean and easy-to-use API that is immutable and has better support for internationalization and time zones.

# How to Use the new Date and Time API

The new date and time API is located in the java.time package and includes several classes for working with dates and times. Some of the most important classes in the new API are:

- **LocalDate**: Represents a date without a time zone.

- **LocalTime**: Represents a time without a time zone.

- **LocalDateTime**: Represents a date and time without a time zone.

- **ZonedDateTime**: Represents a date and time with a time zone.

- **Period**: Represents a period of time, such as "3 months" or "5 days".

- **Duration**: Represents a duration of time, such as "5 hours" or "10 minutes".

To use the new date and time API, you need to import the java.time package and then create instances of the various classes. Here are some examples of how to use the new API:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.time.ZonedDateTime;
import java.time.Period;
import java.time.Duration;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a date
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 1); // 2022-01-01
        
        // Create a time
        LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(12, 0); // 12:00
        
        // Create a date and time
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0); // 2022-01-01T12:00
        
        // Create a date and time with a time zone
        ZonedDateTime zonedDateTime = ZonedDateTime.of(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0, 0, ZoneId.of("America/New_York")); // 2022-01-01T12:00-05:00[America/New_York]
        
        // Create a period of time
        Period period = Period.ofMonths(3); // 3 months
        
        // Create a duration of time
        Duration duration = Duration.ofHours(5); // 5 hours
    }
}
```
